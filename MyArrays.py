#LIST COMPREHENSION
#create a one-dimensional array from a list comprehension that produces even integers form 2 through 20

#integers = np.array([x for x in range(2,21,2)])





#You can produce evenly spaced floating-point ranges with NumPy’s linspace function. 
# The function’s first two arguments specify the starting and ending values in the range, 
# and the ending value is included in the array. The optional keyword argument num specifies 
# the number of evenly spaced values to produce—this argument’s default value is 50:








#Broadcasting

#Normally, the arithmetic operations require as operands two arrays of the same size and shape. 
# When one operand is a single value, called a scalar, NumPy performs the element-wise 
# calculations as if the scalar were an array of the same shape as the other operand, 
# but with the scalar value in all its elements. 


# multiplying integer arrays with floating pt arrays (result is floating pt)




#Comparing arrays

#You can compare arrays with individual values and with other arrays. 
# Comparisons are performed element-wise. Such comparisons produce arrays of 
# Boolean values in which each element’s True or False value indicates the comparison result:
